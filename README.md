This is a simple demo of the uusm theme.

To try it out, do

    git clone https://github.com/dankegel/uusm-drupal6-theme-demo.git
    cd uusm-drupal6-theme-demo
    cp sites/default/settings-default.php sites/default/settings.php
    # edit sites/default/settings.php to point to your database
    drush make uusm-theme-demo.make

    # Open http://localhost in a browser; you should see the normal 
    # Drupal 6 installation page, but with a uusm-theme-demo profile.
    # Choose that!
